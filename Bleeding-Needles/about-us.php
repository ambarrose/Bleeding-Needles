      <h4 class="mt-4 mx-4">Marion</h4>
      <p class="mt-4 mx-4">Marion is a visual artist from France.
Marion creates intricate graphic images with ink, organic painting and natural materials. She can lend her hand to different styles, though at the moment she is enjoying tattooing fine linework and detailed pieces.
Marion’s latest explorations involve quality of line, bold black-work and playful splashes of colour. She enjoys the ever-changing landscape of the human canvas, and that no day is the same in the life of a tattooist.</p>
